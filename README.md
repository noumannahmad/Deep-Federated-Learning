# Deep-Federated-Learning

Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning process in which each participant node (or party) retains their data locally and interacts with other participants via a learning protocol. One main driver behind FL is the need to not share data with others due to privacy and confidentially concerns. Another driver is to improve the speed of training a machine learning model by leveraging other participants' training processes.

Setting up such a federated learning system requires setting up a communication infrastructure, converting machine learning algorithms to federated settings and in some cases knowing about the intricacies of security and privacy enabling techniques such as differential privacy and multi-party computation.
